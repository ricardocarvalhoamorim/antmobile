     <string name="about">Ant Mobile was developed by two devoted programmers looking for a better way to search for people and resources in complex information systems.\nThis app consists of two main blocks: the app itself and ANT, the platform that indexes the available information on a daily basis.
            \n\nANT is currently being developed (and tested) at the InfoLab (infolab.fe.up.pt) by José Devezas. It consists of a research platform in the domain of entity oriented search. In this particular case, ANT is focused on the University of Porto\'s information system. It aims at promoting research in this field by providing a basis for integration with other research fields such as indexing strategies, ranking algorithms and, among others, query suggestion. You can check the latest version at ant.fe.up.pt.
    \n\nANT Mobile is the app itself. It started as an idea of solving the particular issue of searching for anything at the University of Porto wherever you are. It resorts to the ANT infrastructure to fetch the search results and show the end users a mobile friendly interface and interaction. Besides that, it also shows additional (hopefully useful) information about the park occupation and the canteens\' menu.
    \n\nWe (very, like 10 minutes ago)recently got a talented designer to handle some interface issues that we were constantly facing. Her name is Ana Reis (big thanks to her), and you can check her portfolio at cargocollective.com/RochaReisDesign.
    \n\nShould you need to get mor information, feel free to get in touch with us at the InfoLab, room I123.
